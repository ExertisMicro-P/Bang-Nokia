			<h2 class="left" style="color:#124191; display:inline-block;">With Nokia’s global reach and mobile technology expertise, there is a role to play in the on-going struggle to achieve a more sustainable, socially responsible world. That’s why Nokia have a range of exciting environmental and social partnerships in place.</h2>
			
			<p class="block left" style="color:#124191; font-weight:bold;">Environmental partnerships</p>
			<p class="block left">Nokia and WWF have had a Global Partnership Agreement in place since 2003.   Nokia both supports WWF's conservation projects and benefits from WWF expertise, to help make our business processes and activities “greener”.  For example, WWF helps us to audit our environmental footprint assessments in different areas and set appropriate targets.</p>
			<p class="block left">Conservation projects include the Living Himalayas initiative and the Affordable Animal Tracker. The latter uses GPS, mobile networks and mapping software to collect and transmit data about the location of tracked or collared animals. Thus helping to inform species and habitat protection. To spread the benefits further, the technical specifications of the Affordable Animal Tracker have been made available to other organisations working on animal protection or species conservation research under a liberal End User License Agreement.</p>
			
			<p class="block left" style="color:#124191; font-weight:bold;">Social partnerships</p>
			<p class="block left">Social issues, ranging from access to education and health to livelihoods and human rights, are also fundamental – and that’s where Nokia’s partnerships with organisations such as UNESCO, Oxfam, Plan International and the British Council come in.</p>
			<ul class="partner-support_list">
	      			<li><span class="bullet--margin"><span style="bold">Nokia’s partnership with UNESCO</span> harnesses mobile communication to serve individuals and support governments as they strive to achieve the goals of the World Declaration of Education for All.</span></li>
	      			<li><span class="bullet--margin">Nokia’s partnership with Oxfam – has inspired a range of projects looking at ways to help people improve their lives and communities with mobile technology – early drought warning being one example.</span></li>
	      			<li><span class="bullet--margin">Nokia’s partnership with Plan International – is helping to improve child rights and early childhood care </span></li>
	      			<li><span class="bullet--margin">Nokia’s partnership with British Council – focusses on improving lives through connectedness and learning</span></li>
      		</ul>
			<p class="block left" style="color:#124191; font-weight:bold;">Industry cooperation</p>
			<p class="block left">Nokia are involved in number of international collaborative programmes to ensure that information and communication technologies (ICT) are as energy and resource efficient as possible. They also seek to explore the extent to which the use of ICT might bring about a net reduction in carbon emissions. Programmes include:</p>
			<ul class="partner-support_list">
	      			<li><span class="bullet--margin">World business council for sustainable development</span></li>
	      			<li><span class="bullet--margin">Global e-sustainability initiative</span></li>
	      			<li><span class="bullet--margin">DigitalEurope</span></li>
	      			<li><span class="bullet--margin">ICT for energy efficiency forum</span></li>
	      			<li><span class="bullet--margin">Digital energy solutions campaign</span></li>
	      			<li><span class="bullet--margin">Step solving the e-waste problem</span></li>
	      			<li><span class="bullet--margin">European Union code of conduct for external power supplies</span></li>
      		</ul>
			<p class="block left" style="color:#124191; font-weight:bold;">Collaboration with policy makers</p>
			<p class="block left">Nokia actively works with governments and other policy makers to develop meaningful and transparent policies around waste, chemicals and energy management and raw materials and resource efficiency. For example, we participate in the European Innovation Partnership on Raw Materials.</p>
			<p class="block left">Additionally, Nokia (working with other businesses through the TENNG consortium) has contributed to EU Commission pilot projects that aim to develop appropriate standards and methodologies for telecommunications products and services. The ultimate aim is to create tools that can be used as the basis for improved impact assessments and policy-making.</p>
